# ⚙️ Bitcos Governance Framework

**Bitcos Pro (BOS)** embraces decentralized decision-making through a **DAO-based governance system**, empowering the community to shape the project’s future transparently and securely.

## 🧭 Governance Principles
1. **Transparency:** All proposals and voting results are recorded on-chain and publicly accessible.  
2. **Participation:** Every BOS token holder has the right to participate, propose, and vote.  
3. **Accountability:** Approved proposals are automatically executed via smart contracts, ensuring trustless governance.
